# Contribute for Voidy!

**Contributing is kept very simple**! Just clone the repository and duplicate the [en_EN.json](../lang/en-EN.json) language file and translate it in your language. Once done, you can submit a pull request for us to approve or reject any applied changes. If approved, expect your changes to be applied within the next `3-7 days`. 

##### We have a couple specific markdowns in our string list, **do NOT translate the following markdowns below in your language!**
